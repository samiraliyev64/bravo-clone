# Bravo Supermarket Clone - E-commerce Platform

I built the modern and user-friendly Bravo Supermarket Clone e-commerce application with React.js.

## üì¶ Features
- **Basket Logic**: Users can easily add or remove products from their shopping basket, with an updated total price displayed in real-time.
- **Discount Countdown**: I used **Local Storage**, a countdown clock is shown to highlight ongoing discounts, enhancing the urgency of limited-time offers.
- **Product Wishlist**: Users can save their favorite products to a **Wishlist** for future reference.
- **Search Functionality**: A fully integrated search bar enables users to quickly find products.
- **Carousel Images**: Engaging product imagery is showcased using **Ant Design**'s carousel component, adding a dynamic and visually appealing element to the interface.
- **Responsive UI**: I built a **User-centered UI/UX** design, the application is responsive, ensuring optimal functionality across all devices including mobile phones, tablets, laptops, and desktops.
- **React Router**: Seamless navigation between pages is handled with **React Router DOM**, making it easy for users to navigate between login, product listings, and other sections of the app.
- **Icons**: Interactive and informative **React Icons** are used for intuitive design elements and better user interaction.
